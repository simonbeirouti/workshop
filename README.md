# Betta UX

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/simonbeirouti/workshop
cd workshop
npm ci
```

Run the project:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Run the project:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can reference the file lib/functions.js for the Juno calls and the datastores.js for data examples. 

### Deployment

Deploying the project is as simple as:

Setting up Juno:

```bash
npm i -g @junobuild/cli
```

Once the installation is complete, we log in to grant access from our terminal to our satellite.

```bash
juno login
```

Finally, we deploy our project.

```bash
juno deploy
```

Congratulations! Your dApp has been launched on chain 🎉.

### Initialization

Before we can integrate Juno into the app, we’ll need to create a satellite. This process is explained in detail in the [documentation](https://juno.build/docs/add-juno-to-an-app/create-a-satellite).

> New developers will also need to sign in to Juno's [console](https://console.juno.build) and may even need to create an Internet Identity.

Once the satellite is created, we can initialize Juno with its ID.

First, configure the satellite ID in the `juno.config.mjs` file.

> TODO: find and replace STEP_1_CONFIGURATION

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from "@junobuild/config";

/** @type {import('@junobuild/config').JunoConfig} */
export default defineConfig({
  satellite: {
    // TODO: STEP_1_CONFIGURATION
    id: "replace-satellite-id",
    source: "dist",
  },
});
```

Then, enable the initialization of the library within the application.

> TODO: find and replace STEP_2_INITIALIZATION

```javascript
await initSatellite();
```

### Authentication

To securely identify users anonymously, they will need to sign in.

> TODO: find and replace STEP_3_AUTH_SIGN_IN

```javascript
import { signIn } from "@junobuild/core";

await signIn();
```

To get to know the user’s state, Juno provides an observable function called `authSubscribe()`. We can use it as many times as required, but I find it convenient to subscribe to it at the top of an app.

> TODO: find and replace STEP_4_AUTH_SUBSCRIBE

```typescript
import { authSubscribe, type User } from "@junobuild/core";

const sub = authSubscribe((user: User | null) => console.log(user));
```

Users should obviously also be able to sign out.

> TODO: find and replace STEP_5_AUTH_SIGN_OUT

```javascript
import { signOut } from "@junobuild/core";

await signOut();
```

### Storing Documents

Storing data on the blockchain with Juno is done through a feature called “Datastore”. Follow the instructions in the documentation to create a collection, which can be named accordingly (“notes”).

Once our collection is created, we can persist data on the blockchain using the `setDoc` function.

> TODO: find and replace STEP_6_SET_DOC

```javascript
await setDoc({
  collection: "notes",
  doc: {
    key,
    data: {
      text: inputText,
    },
  },
});
```

---

### Listing Documents

To fetch the list of documents saved on the blockchain, we can use the `listDocs` function.

> TODO: find and replace STEP_7_LIST_DOCS

```javascript
const { items } = await listDocs({
  collection: "notes",
});
```

---

### Uploading Files

As for the documents, to upload assets we will need first to create a collection in the “Storage”. We can be name it “images”.

Once our collection is set, we can upload a file on chain using the `uploadFile` function.

> TODO: find and replace STEP_8_UPLOAD_FILE

```javascript
const { downloadUrl } = await uploadFile({
  collection: "images",
  data: file,
  filename,
});
```

In this particular workshop, we also want to save a reference within the document to its related asset.

> TODO: find and replace STEP_9_ADD_REFERENCE

```javascript
await setDoc({
  collection: "notes",
  doc: {
    key,
    data: {
      text: inputText,
      ...(url !== undefined && { url }), // <--- We add this reference
    },
  },
});
```
